# Reports

Based on the Liferay DXP Reportin Module (https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/15100467)
you can use Jasper Reports to create interesting business reports.
This can be either based on the Liferay database like, what is the average rating on my blogs, how many users do I have in my system or how many assets do I have in total.  
And you can create reports on other databases like a CRM, business application that stores information in a database and more.  
This repo contains some sample reports. If you have any usefull report please share it with the owner of this repo (@jverweijL)
